TODO
====

Make far objects brighter, possibly by adding bright faces \
on the geometry in front of each word and toggling visibility \
based on distance.
Improve controls.
Refactor code.
Non-linear move transitions.
Make far objects easier to click / create zones for far object clusters.

BUGS
====

Closer words are being obscured by further away words, sometimes.
Tween destinations are miscalculating when dev console is open in chrome.
WSADQE controls are activating while inputting text to search box.

MAYBE
=====

Add a tiny cursor so users can see their rotation point.
Single left click for rotation, double left click for move-to-word.
